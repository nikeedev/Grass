## Grass, a WIP game engine.

Grass, is a WIP game engine made by me @nikeedev :)
It is based on C++ and SDL library, where the engine can run great on 2D games and applications.

Q: Why i build the engine?

A: I'm a young but very passion game developer. I'm learning game development and programming languages, which i together combined, so i can build games while learning the language too.  

I found C++ very interesting language, so i got on, and worked with it. 
I learn SDL2 on the way so i can also make some games, but really, i like to make game engines. 
Thats first time i build a game engine completely using C++ and a media library, but also i do it alone, that way, i can choose how the enigne would be and decide what it should be based on. Grass engine, is a example of that, therefore i build it.
